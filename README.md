**About the artificial neural network:**

This program is an artificial neural network, created with JavasCript. At the start it chooses a random color, and tries to guess if it's a light or dark color thanks to the mathematical principles of neural networks. It works with supervised learning so if it missguess the result, it trains and increases the chance of etting the result right the next tries. after a lot of training, the percentage of good answers should increase.
