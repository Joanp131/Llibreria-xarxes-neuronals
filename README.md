## What is this?

All those archives are part of an artificisl neural network.

**About the artificial neural network:**

This program is an artificial neural network, created with JavasCript. At the start it chooses a random color, and tries to guess if it's a light or dark color thanks to the mathematical principles of neural networks. It works with supervised learning so if it missguess the result, it trains and increases the chance of etting the result right the next tries. after a lot of training, the percentage of good answers should increase.

**About the archives.**

1. **Carpet: P5.js:** p5.js is a javascript library that allows you to implement [Processing](https://processing.org/) functions in the web browser. More information at their [official web page](https://p5js.org/).

2. **Index.HTML:** HTML is a programming language that allows you to create webpages. the archive *Index.HTML* is the archive that has to be executed in order to inicaite the artificial neural network in the browser. The default application used to open it is the default web browser of your computer.

3. **Matrix.js:** Matrices allow us to work easely with neural networks, because we can store lots of numbers in them. *Matrix.js* is a library where you can find some basic matrix operations such as: addition, subtraction, multiplication, translation... And other necessary functions for our neural network. It was created by [Daniel Shiffman](https://github.com/shiffman), in his YouTube channel: [TheCodingTrain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSzGdfdOoG8&index=6&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6aCibgK1PTWWu9by6XFdCfh)
